UE4 dev junk
So Dreamer, has grown from the early days of electronic engineering, way back when logic was on PC boards and etched and developed like film. Really impressed with the gains in technology and embrassing VR, 3D, real 3D, and realtime animation characters in virtual spaces. So the latest team goal is to create a super team of UE4 Jugs for development of shared ownership in a new commpany that produces VR and game style interactive content. I welcome and enjoy your company and interactions with me in this exciting, thrashing world journey.
